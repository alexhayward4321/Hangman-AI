Need to separate current API into a game one and an AI one. 
Game one must have an AI and a human mode
Need easy communication between AI object and game object



Ideas
- Would it be possible to have the AI do one guess for you while your 
  playing in human mode (an extenstion - don't think about this during
  initial separation)
- Start separation by literally separating all of the AI and the gaming
  part
